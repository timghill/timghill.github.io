The SubAerial Drainage System (SaDS) model is a physically-based dynamic model that represents meltwater flow across the glacier surface in both a distributed sheet and through supraglacial streams. SaDS dynamically evolves the incision depth and width of supraglacial streams, allowing us to dynamically evolve the stream network.

Check back for an upcoming publication. For now, select results are below.

Moulin inputs, flow through supraglacial channels, and distributed meltwater flow for synthetic ice sheet margin geometry.

Modelled drainage system compared to map by Yang and Smith (2016). SaDS predicts a nearly identical network of supraglacial rivers as observed in satellite imagery, and naturally grows and drains supraglacial lakes.
