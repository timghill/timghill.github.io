I'm a PhD candidate at Simon Fraser University. I'm interested in applying numerical models to physical and environmental systems, especially glaciers and ice sheets.

My current research focuses on modelling subglacial drainage. In particular, I'm interested in using statistical techniques to address uncertainty in contemporary models. The outputs of this research will improve the representation of basal friction in ice-sheet models, enabling more robust ice-sheet model projections.

For my Masters from the University of Waterloo in Applied Math, I developed numerical models for [glacier surface melt rates](/projects/seb/) and [supraglacial meltwater transport](/projects/sads/). These models contribute to our understanding of water resources, the impact of freshwater discharge on downstream ecosystems, glacier mass balance, and the connection between warming and glacier dynamics.

I completed my BSc at the University of Waterloo in Co-operative Mathematical Physics. Through co-op terms at Environment and Climate Change Canada, I was part of the team that provided the first-ever estimates of power plant CO<sub>2</sub> emissions using satellite measurements.

Outside of research, I enjoy rock climbing, camping, hiking, trail running, canoeing, and anything else I can try!

I'm always happy to chat over a (virtual) coffee, just send me an email at [tim_hill_2@sfu.ca](mailto:tim_hill_2@sfu.ca).
