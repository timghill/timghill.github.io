I'm an MMATH candidate in Applied Math at the University of Waterloo. I'm generally interested in applying numerical models to physical systems, particularly glaciers and ice sheets.

For my MMATH, I am developing numerical models to apply to glaciers and ice sheets. I recently adapted a surface energy balance model and applied it to Kaskawulsh and Nàłùdäy (Lowell) Glaciers in the Yukon. I'm now developing a supraglacial hydrology model for mountain glaciers and ice sheets to better understand meltwater inputs to the subglacial drainage system. This new model will simultaneously model flow through supraglacial streams and flow across the ice surface between channels, while allowing the stream network to dynamically evolve.

I completed my BSc at the University of Waterloo in Co-operative Mathematical Physics with a focus on numerical modelling and data analysis through co-op work terms.

Outside of research, I enjoy rock climbing, camping, hiking, trail running, canoeing, and anything else I can try!
