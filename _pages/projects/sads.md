The SubAerial Drainage System (SaDS) model is a physically-based dynamic model that represents meltwater flow across the glacier surface in both a distributed sheet and through supraglacial streams. SaDS dynamically evolves the incision depth and width of supraglacial streams, allowing us to dynamically evolve the stream network.
