Contemporary subglacial drainage models typically assume that subglacial water flow is exclusively laminar or turbulent, but do not verify the validity of the assumed flow regime. In this project, we adapted the Glacier Drainage System (GlaDS) model to allow for transitions between laminar and turbulent flow in the distributed drainage system, based on the local Reynolds number. Based on a comparison between turbulent, laminar, and the newly implemented "transition" model, we recommend the transition model for future transient subglacial drainage simulations based on improved winter water presure, manageable spring and summer pressure peaks, and its internal consistency with regards to the flow regime.
