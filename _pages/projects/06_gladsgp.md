title: "Statistical emulation of subglacial drainage models"
permalink: /projects/glads-gp/
---

Subglacial hydrology and ice-sheet models are key tools for glaciological process studies and for making future projections of glacier change. Despite their successes, physics-based models are limited by their computational cost and uncertainty, including parameter, structural, and input uncertainties. This project uses statistical emulation to explore the application of Bayesian calibration and uncertainty quantification to subglacial drainage models.
