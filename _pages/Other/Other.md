# Computational resources 
Depending on your faculty, there are a few different servers you can use to run your jobs.

 * [Compute Canada](https://www.computecanada.ca/research-portal/) is available to all group members. Compute Canada is a network of supercomputer clusters intended for general academic research use. Compute Canada machines can run jobs ranging from small single CPU jobs to massively parallel jobs. There is some learning curve to working in this environment, but it really is the best place for jobs with large CPU or memory requirements.
 * [linux.math servers](https://uwaterloo.ca/math-faculty-computing-facility/services/research-and-staff-linux-servers) are available to Math faculty students and researchers and are administered by MFCF. There are three pools of servers depending on your usage case. The general `linux.math` server is a great place to run small to medium sized jobs that are either just a little to large (in memory or run time) to run locally.

# Documentation
There are a few different ways to build online documentation for your projects. This documentation could be a few simple pages to share your model/code/etc. within this group, or it could be public documentation you publish along with a model you develop.

The simplest choice is including a `README` file in your code repository. The next step up might be including a small Github (or Git Lab) wiki describing your project. For a project you are sharing widely, online documentation is a good choice. See these pages for more information on online documentation hosting:

 * [Readthedocs](https://uwglacier.github.io/other/rtd): Free online documentation hosting based on Markdown or Sphinx with Github integration.
 * [Github Pages](https://uwglacier.github.io/other/pages): Similar to Readthedocs, but hosted by github. This is how this wiki site is built! Github Pages can build documentation from Markdown (like for this wiki), or can host html pages. This makes Github pages more flexible than RTD.

# Latex
Latex can be a good tool for writing papers that include a lot of math, and is strongly encouraged for [Applied math theses](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/university-of-waterloo-thesis-template/rndjnzvhjqfk).
